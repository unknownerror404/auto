## Changelog Titles

You can customize the changelog titles and even add custom ones. To see configuration [go here](../autorc.md#changelog-titles).

## Additional Release notes

Sometimes a PR title is just not enough to capture what a user should know about that PR. That's why we've included the ability to put extra release notes right in your PRs. All you have to do is add a `Release Notes` section in your PR.

Take the following PR body:

```md
# What Changed

Change `shipit` behavior.

## Release Notes

`auto shipit` will only ship to `latest` on the base branch ([which is configurable]()). If ran locally or from a PR it will create a `canary` release that doesn't interfere with your `latest` release.
```

This will create a special section at the top of the changelog that collects all the additional release notes from merged PRs. Below is a sample of what it might look like.

### Release Notes

_From #371_

`auto shipit` will only ship to `latest` on the base branch ([which is configurable]()). If ran locally or from a PR it will create a `canary` release that doesn't interfere with your `latest` release.
